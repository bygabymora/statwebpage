            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>A. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. </strong>This Agreement and
            all aspects of the Sites and Company Services shall be governed by
            and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
            Florida, without regard to conflict of law provisions. With respect
            to any disputes or claims not subject to informal dispute resolution
            or arbitration (as set forth below), you agree not to commence or
            prosecute any action in connection therewith other than in the state
            and federal courts located in Hillsborough County, State of Florida,
            and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of
            personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to,
            venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application
            of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
            Sale of Goods is excluded from this Agreement. Additionally,
            application of the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act
            (UCITA) is excluded from this Agreement. In no event shall any
            claim, action or proceeding by you related in any way to the Sites
            or Company Services be instituted more than two (2) years after the
            cause of action arose.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>B.Informal Resolution.</strong> To expedite resolution and
            control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to
            this Agreement (&quot;Dispute&quot;), you and Company agree to first
            attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly
            provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before
            initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal
            negotiations commence upon written notice from one person to the
            other.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>C. Binding Arbitration.</strong> If you and Company are
            unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either
            you or Company may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes
            expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by
            binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be
            final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS
            PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY
            TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the
            Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association
            (&quot;AAA&quot;) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary
            Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (&quot;AAA Consumer
            Rules&quot;), both of which are available at the AAA website
            www.adr.org. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to
            arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and
            determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration
            fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by
            the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA
            Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be
            excessive, Company will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The
            arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of
            documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision
            in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless
            requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and
            any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except
            where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable
            law, the arbitration will take place in Hillsborough County, State
            of Florida. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and
            Company may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
            proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or
            enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>D. Restrictions.</strong> You and Company agree that any
            arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between Company and you
            individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no
            arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or
            authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis
            or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or
            authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
            representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other
            persons.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>
              E. Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration.
            </strong>{" "}
            You and Company agree that the following Disputes are not subject to
            the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding
            arbitration: (1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
            concerning the validity of any of your or Company’s intellectual
            property rights; (2) any Dispute related to, or arising from,
            allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized
            use; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief. If this Section is
            found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Company
            will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of
            this Section found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute
            shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the
            courts listed for jurisdiction above, and you and Company agree to
            submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
          <p>
            This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and
            Company regarding the use of the Company Services. The failure of
            Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this
            Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
            The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and
            have no legal or contractual effect. This Agreement operates to the
            fullest extent permissible by law. This Agreement and your account
            may not be assigned by you without our express written consent.
            Company may assign any or all of its rights and obligations to
            others at any time. Company shall not be responsible or liable for
            any loss, damage, delay or failure to act caused by any cause beyond
            Company&apos;s reasonable control. If any provision or part of a
            provision of this Agreement is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that
            provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from this
            Agreement and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any
            remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership,
            employment or agency relationship created between you and Company as
            a result of this Agreement or use of the Sites and Company Services.
            Upon Company’s request, you will furnish Company any documentation,
            substantiation or releases necessary to verify your compliance with
            this Agreement. You agree that this Agreement will not be construed
            against Company by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive
            any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of
            this Agreement and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to
            execute this Agreement.
