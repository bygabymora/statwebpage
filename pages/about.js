            Stat Surgical was founded to combat the rising costs of healthcare
            supply chains. Our company targets the &quot;small&quot; portion of
            &quot;off-contract&quot; purchases and backorders. Stat Surgical
            strictly focuses on sourcing safe, ethical products from trusted
            suppliers, US-based hospitals, and surgery centers. We source
            surgical disposables in original OEM packaging, sealed, long-dated,
            and strictly inspected by our trained quality control department.
            When doing business with Stat Surgical you can buy products by the
            &quot;each,&quot; or by the &quot;box.&quot; With 20+ years of
            surgical sales experience, the founder has a wealth of knowledge of
            cost savings and the ability to navigate healthcare systems and
            IDNs. As surgical disposable costs rise, numerous healthcare systems
            rely on us for cost savings. Our customers are &quot;priority
            one.&quot;
